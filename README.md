# Project Description

This project is a basic E-commerce React application. It comprises features such as fetching data through API from the server, shopping cart, search bar, and checkout process. 

A fake server, using the JSON server tool, is used to fetch the data from the server. The React Router is used to navigate through pages. Hooks like `usesate`, `useefect`, and `usecontext` are used to have access to the state and other React features. `usecontext` hook is used to implement the shopping cart and access it through the application.
